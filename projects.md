### Unveiling Wholeness Podcast
The intention of this podcast is to explore the nature of things by questioning and engaging in deep dialectic conversations. This podcast hosts a variety of guests from many different backgrounds, including spirituality, business, ecology, agriculture, sustainability, and pretty much everything. We ultimately have to get along on this planet of ours, and perhaps dialogue and conversation are one means of doing that!
