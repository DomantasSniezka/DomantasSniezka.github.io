It's a fact that, as human beings, we have certain survival needs. To continue living, we must meet these survival needs; there is simply no other way to survive as a human. We share our planet with millions of life forms, ranging from bacteria, viruses, plants, animals, and other humans. Each life form must fulfill its own survival needs in a way that is natural to them. While it's beautiful to learn about the ways of nature, there seems to be an order within the natural world, even if at times we may perceive disorder.

So, our real challenge is to meet our human survival needs without unnecessarily destroying other life forms, although a certain level of destruction is inevitable if we are to live at all. It's quite obvious that there is inequality throughout the world. Some countries are wealthier than others, some people are better off than others, and so on. It's also the case that millions are starving, ill, lacking adequate shelter, and homeless. Furthermore, there is pollution, corruption, war, conflict, and deforestation throughout the world, with some places experiencing these issues more than others, but they exist everywhere. As ordinary individuals concerned with our own livelihoods, we may rarely think about these matters since we already have so much to consider in our own lives. I believe it's a valid point to say that we must provide for the basic survival needs of all of humanity, not just a few of us.

It seems to me that this is possible given our current scientific and technical understanding. However, this is not just a technical problem; it's a human problem rooted within the human mind. Unless we address the fundamental root cause and truly understand the source of our disorder, it's inevitable that further disorder will continue to arise
