Hi, I'm Dom!

Thanks for stepping by!

This site was created for the purpose of sharing my interests and explorations with the rest of the world. 

For some strange reason, I find it a very appealing thing to do, so here I am!

### What am I doing **Now**?

Currently I'm working as a technical writer for a technology company.

In my free time I like to go on [long walks](www.instagram.com/domsniezka), [read](), [write](https://domsniezka.substack.com/), [create podcasts](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAfOGjEqPTxD15V-lAQZrZkCBF5MU1Xv2) among other things.
