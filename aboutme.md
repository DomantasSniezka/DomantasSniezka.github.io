subtitle: Why do what I do?
---

To do what I love, I must share what I love with other people. What I find interesting is exploring what I am uniquely designed to do. This site is an expression of that interest. It doesn't mean it's static; it's going to evolve over time along with the projects that come with it. I find great joy in exploring the things that interest me and sharing them with those who are interested in hearing about what I explore. It may be about making pancakes or philosophy, but that doesn't matter.

I feel like every one of us has something unique in our nature, something that only we can do. It doesn't make sense to follow anyone else or to do what they say we should do. This website simply shares what I find interesting to explore with whoever wishes to listen. I do this for my own enjoyment, and perhaps I'll attract people who also find this interesting.

Just like anyone, I have a wide range of interests. For some strange reason, I find it interesting to share them with other people, just like a musician plays for their audience. After all, that's what we are all doing to a certain extent: we explore and express what we find interesting. If people find what we do interesting, they may become our friends. If they don't, they won't even engage with what is expressed.

I just know there are things I need to express, and I must do them. Am I perfect? No. Do I act with perfect intelligence? No. Have mistakes been made? Yes. Yet I have to live, do, and act. There is no other way. So here I am, moving, acting, expressing!
